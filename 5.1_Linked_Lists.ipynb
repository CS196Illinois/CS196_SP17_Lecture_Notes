    "### What is a \"Linked List\"? ###\n",
    "Linked lists is a data structure that stores information with pointers and nodes!\n",
    "\n",
    "For this homework set, you will consider what we call \"Singly Linked\" Lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are usually represented in arrow notation like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mbox{1} \\rightarrow \\mbox{2} \\rightarrow \\mbox {4} \\rightarrow \\mbox{5} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means we have a linked list that has a `1` then a `2` then a `4` then a `5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "By notation, we call the first element a \"head\" and the last element a \"tail\".\n",
    "\n",
    "You can go [here](https://visualgo.net/list) for a visualizer. I recommend going over this over before reading my examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Linked Lists? ###\n",
    "Linked Lists are often shied away from their cousin, the Array. In terms of sequential storage, arrays are much more intuitive and faster to access elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition is this: let's make a shopping list.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have two options here: make it on a single page of lined paper that we have, or tape small pieces of paper together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, our single page of binder paper is cheap. We only have 5 lines on the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to buy a Potato, Lettuce, Orange, Homework 1 Answers for CS 196, and 5 Bitcoins at your local supermarket.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our \"array\" (binder paper) looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Shopping List (Binder Paper)            |\n",
    "|-------------------------|\n",
    "| Potato                  |\n",
    "| Lettuce                 |\n",
    "| Orange                  |\n",
    "| Homework 1 Answers      |\n",
    "| 5 Bitcoins              |\n",
    "\n",
    "Our \"linked list\" (pieces of small paper taped togther) looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Potato} \\leftrightharpoons \\text{Lettuce} \\leftrightharpoons \\text{Orange} \\leftrightharpoons \\text{Homework 1 Answers} \\leftrightharpoons \\text{5 Bitcoins}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have 2 representations for the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "But your roommate just called and said \"Hey we need a new microwave because the one we have right now just broke when I microwaved aluminum\".\n",
    "\n",
    "So we need to add \"microwave\" to our shopping list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we are adding microwave to the Binder Paper\n",

    "$$\\text{Potato} \\leftrightharpoons \\text{Lettuce} \\leftrightharpoons \\text{Orange} \\leftrightharpoons \\text{Homework 1 Answers} \\leftrightharpoons \\text{5 Bitcoins}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "But we could just by 6 lines of binder paper to begin with! Yes, we could've gotten a larger binder paper to begin with, but if we didn't know how many items we had on our list, it's hard to buy the right binder paper.\n",

    "### Practical Examples: Linked List vs Array ###\n",
    "Here is an example of Insertions and Deletions\n",
    "#### Array: Insertion ####\n",
    "$$ \\boxed{1} \\boxed{2} \\boxed{4} \\boxed{5} \\boxed{10} \\boxed{12}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to insert a 1000 in the 3rd element.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to make space for the 3rd parameter to do that we'll need to shift a lot of elements to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\boxed{1} \\boxed{2} \\boxed{4} \\boxed{empty space} \\boxed{5} \\boxed{10} \\boxed{12}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And we moved 3 elements just to insert a 3rd.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\boxed{1} \\boxed{2} \\boxed{4} \\boxed{1000} \\boxed{5} \\boxed{10} \\boxed{12}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### List: Insertion ####\n",
    "$$ 1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 10 \\rightarrow 12 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that list is made of references to the next node (formally known as `pointers`)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to insert a 1000 in the 3rd element, we can just \"pretend\" we shifted everything by swapping pointers!\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow NEW NODE \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 10 \\rightarrow 12 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 1000 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 10 \\rightarrow 12 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though it looks like we moved 3 elements, we actually did not move at all!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Array: Deletion ####\n",
    "$$ \\boxed{1} \\boxed{2} \\boxed{4} \\boxed{1000} \\boxed{5} \\boxed{10} \\boxed{12}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to remove the 1000 we just inserted.\n",
    "\n",
    "We work backwards. So we \"delete\" by shifting everything to the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\boxed{1} \\boxed{2} \\boxed{4} \\boxed{5} \\boxed{10} \\boxed{12}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to remove the 1000 we just inserted.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Why Linked Lists? (Formally) ###\n",
    "Someone in lecture, we talk about runtime. More formally, the runtime is represented in big-O notation, saying that the growth rate of the runtime has some special property.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when we say \"insertion takes O(n)\" (pronounced oh-s of enn) we mean insertion grows linearly with the data elements, when there are `n` data elements. When we say \"insertion takes O(1)\" (pronounced oh-s of one), we mean insertion does not grow (stays constant) with the data, when there are `n` elements. You will learn this formally in CS 173.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operation | Array         | Linked Lists |\n",
    "|-----------|---------------|--------------|\n",
    "| Insertion | O(n)      | O(1)     |\n",

    "| Element Access | O(1)      | O(n) worst case  |\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, Linked Lists are better when we need to do a lot of write/delete operations!\n",
    "\n",
    "Disclaimer: You will learn in CS225 that is not so true after all.\n"
